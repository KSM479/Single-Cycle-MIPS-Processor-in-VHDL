## Single Cycle MIPS Processor in VHDL

The MIPS_TopModule need to be set as the top module for the processor. We using buttons and switches to provide input and using 7 segment display of the Basys 3 Board as well as the LEDs to display the output. 

The assembly instructions written in the instruction memory are only for the test purpose. They do mimic the behavior of RC 5 Block Cipher - Key Generation and Encryption.

Basically all the signals of the processor are brought out to provide an extremely thorough execution with all the necessary details/variables visible. 

A Constraint file for the Basys Board is also attached herewith. 


Please Note - That this is only Rev 2 - The testbench file for this processor is not included.

Thank you very much. for more information please email me on - ksm469@nyu.edu!
